## 7 Things we should know ( Summary )

1. TOR itself is still secure at the cryptographic level, but users can be deanonymized through browser exploits, misconfiguration, or traffic analysis rather than breaking tor's core design.

2. It is not just used by criminal or for criminal activities but it is widely used by everyone such as families, activists, journalists, even the military for privacy and secure communication because tor actually helps protect ordinary users from threats like identity theft and online stalking.
   
3. TOR was funded by US Navy at the begining, but it has no military backdoor. It is open source, regularly audited by experts and mainted by privacy- focused activist, ensuring its trustworthiness and transparency.

4. Running a Tor relay is generally legal in the U.S. (the EFF runs one), but exit relays can attract law-enforcement attention; using Tor for criminal activity increases your legal risk and harms the network’s reputation.

5. Tor is easy to use, just download the Tor Browser Bundle or use Tails, a live OS that routes all traffic through Tor and leaves no trace after shutdown.

6. Tor is slower than normal internet, but it has improved over time. The best way to help speed it up is by running more relays.

7. Tor is powerful anonymity software but must be used correctly, always with Tor Browser or Tails, updated regularly. While it can’t hide activity from services you log into or defeat global traffic analysis, it remains one of the best tools for protecting online privacy.
   
### Hiding behind the keyboard ( Summary)

Tor was originally developed by the U.S. Navy to secure government communications, but it was later made available to the public to protect privacy, support free speech, and bypass censorship. It works through onion routing, where data is encrypted in layers and sent through multiple relays so that no single point can trace both sender and receiver. While Tor is often used for legitimate purposes like journalism and activism, criminals sometimes try to exploit it. Law enforcement can track illegal activity by taking advantage of software flaws, user mistakes, or traffic analysis, but the Tor network itself remains secure for most users.

#### a. Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). DONE 

##### b. Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment. DOONE
